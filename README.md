# Unum

Unum innovates across all layers of data-processing infrastructure:

* Storage: Persistent Data Structures, Compression and Zero-Copy Async IO,
* Compute: Matrix Multiplications, Graph Algorithms and Compiler Design,
* Modeling: Universal Encoder Architectures for Semantic Search.

For every layer we prepare a range of products, mostly written in C++ 20, CUDA 17 and Assembly for SIMD acceleration on x86 and Arm.
